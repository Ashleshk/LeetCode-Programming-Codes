## valid e-mail 

A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:

The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.
The domain is '@leetcode.com'.
Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 2       | Jonathan  | jonathanisgreat         |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
| 5       | Marwan    | quarz#2020@leetcode.com |
| 6       | David     | david69@gmail.com       |
| 7       | Shapiro   | .shapo@leetcode.com     |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
Output: 
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
Explanation: 
The mail of user 2 does not have a domain.
The mail of user 5 has the # sign which is not allowed.
The mail of user 6 does not have the leetcode domain.
The mail of user 7 starts with a period.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select * from Users
where mail REGEXP '^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_\.\-]*@leetcode(\\?com)?\\.com$';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE regexp_like(mail, '^[A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9\_\.\-]*@leetcode\\.com$')
```

^ means the beginning of the string

This is important because without it, we can have something like
'.shapiro@leetcode.com'
This is because part of the regex matches the pattern perfectly.
The part that is 'shapiro@leetcode.com'.
This is how I understand it: regex will return the whole
thing as long as part of it matches. By adding ^ we are saying: you have to
match FROM THE START.
[] means character set. [A-Z] means any upper case chars. In other words,
the short dash in the character set means range.

After the first and the second character set, there is a notation: + or *.

means at least one of the character from the preceding charset, and * means
0 or more.
\ inside the charset mean skipping. In other words, \. means we want the dot as
it is. Remember, for example, - means range in the character set. So what if
we would like to find - itself as a character? use **\-**.

Everything else, like @leetcode[.]com refers to exact match.
