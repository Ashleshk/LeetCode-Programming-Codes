Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+

| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num;
```
