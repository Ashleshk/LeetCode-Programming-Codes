##  Write your MySQL query statement below

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

```sql
SELECT  MAX(SALARY) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY <>(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE);
```
METHOD-2
```sql
SELECT(SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary 
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)AS SecondHighestSalary;
```
METHOD-3
```sql

SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
